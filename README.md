# Youtube Clone

You probably haven't met a single person alive who hasn't either heard of or been on youtube.  It's a great place to search for a broad range of videos from cats doing funny things, to how to rebuild a car.  Well I wanted to see if I could build a clone of the concept by tapping into the Youtube API and based on what the user searches, bringing up a list of 5 related videos, while also letting the user view the videos themselves.

## Challenges ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This was a fun project to take on but also had to do quite a bit of research because I wasn't too familiar with video components.  Researching the Youtube API and reading the documentation helped me to figure out the general idea of how I would be able to access the API the way I needed to.

Another challenge I encountered was with the styling.  Semantic UI is a powerful styling library and very fun to dive into.  It is limited in some aspects for positioning which is why I implemented CSS grid.  I'd only heard about it before but truly came to recognize it's ability for placing components where they need to go on a page.  I look forward to working with the grid system further.
